                When we refer to personal information we mean information from
                which your identity is reasonably apparent. This information may

                Credit information is information which is used to assess your

                finance that you have outstanding, your repayment history in
                respect of those loans, and any defaults. Usually, credit
                information is exchanged between credit and finance providers
                and credit reporting bodies.
