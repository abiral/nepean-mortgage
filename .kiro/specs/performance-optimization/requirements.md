# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the performance of the Nepean Mortgage React application to improve user experience through faster load times, better resource utilization, and enhanced runtime performance. The optimization will address bundle size reduction, lazy loading improvements, caching strategies, and build optimizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the application to load quickly on first visit, so that I can access mortgage information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site for the first time THEN the initial page load SHALL complete within 3 seconds on a standard 3G connection
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the First Contentful Paint (FCP) SHALL occur within 1.5 seconds
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) SHALL occur within 2.5 seconds
4. WHEN the main bundle is analyzed THEN it SHALL be under 500KB gzipped

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want subsequent page navigations to be instant, so that I can browse different sections smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between routes THEN the navigation SHALL complete within 200ms
2. WHEN lazy-loaded components are accessed THEN they SHALL load within 500ms
3. WHEN the same route is visited again THEN it SHALL load from cache instantly
4. WHEN components are preloaded THEN they SHALL be available before user interaction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want images and assets to load efficiently, so that the page doesn't feel sluggish or broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use modern formats (WebP/AVIF) with fallbacks
2. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL be properly sized and optimized for their display context
3. WHEN images are below the fold THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded
4. WHEN critical images load THEN they SHALL be preloaded or inlined

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the application to work smoothly on mobile devices, so that I can access mortgage services on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on mobile THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps during interactions
2. WHEN the application loads on mobile THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized for slower connections
3. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN they SHALL respond within 100ms
4. WHEN the application runs on low-end devices THEN it SHALL remain functional and responsive

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized, so that deployments are faster and the application performs better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN unused code SHALL be eliminated through tree shaking
2. WHEN dependencies are bundled THEN they SHALL be properly code-split and cached
3. WHEN the build runs THEN it SHALL generate optimized chunks for better caching
4. WHEN static assets are processed THEN they SHALL be compressed and optimized

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want API calls to be efficient, so that dynamic content loads quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately to avoid redundant requests
2. WHEN the application starts THEN critical API data SHALL be prefetched
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with retry mechanisms
4. WHEN multiple similar requests are made THEN they SHALL be deduplicated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the application to work offline or with poor connectivity, so that I can still access basic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed offline THEN cached content SHALL be available
2. WHEN connectivity is poor THEN the application SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
3. WHEN the application comes back online THEN it SHALL sync any pending data
4. WHEN critical resources fail to load THEN fallback content SHALL be displayed
